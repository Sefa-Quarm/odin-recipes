    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>
      Few things are as easy to prepare as these pan-fried boneless pork chops.
      They take only minutes to prepare! <br />
      The emphasis is on the great flavor of pork, so if you'd like more
      seasoning, go for it. For perfectly done chops, <br />
      always use a meat thermometer.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless <strong>chops</strong> , 3/4-inch thick</li>
      <li><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong> to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose <strong>flour</strong></li>
      <li>Â½ cup <strong> Cooking oil</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick</li>
      <li>
        Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with
        flour on both sides. <br />Use the back of a spoon to distribute the
        flour over the entire surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until it
        shimmers. Carefully add pork chops and pan fry until brown, about 4
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan fry the
        other side until no longer pink on the inside and brown on the outside,
        an additional 4 minutes
      </li>
    </ol>
